## Signature

Signature generation is dependent on the APIs being called. Some API do not require signature, while others require. Note the “Signature” section for each API for the list of data required to be included for signature generation.

For those API which require signature, signature generation goes through the same process as Payment API \(see: [docs.pipwave.com](https://docs.pipwave.com/)\)

Put the resulting string in “signature” parameter when making the API request.
