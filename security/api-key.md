## API Key

All calls must include the api\_key parameter \(which will be reminded in individual API documents\). In addition to including this parameter in the request body, every request must also contain the x-api-key header which contains the same key. This allows us to quickly verify the authenticity of the request before proceeding to process the API request. The API Key can be obtained from Merchant portal &gt; Development &gt; Setting page.
